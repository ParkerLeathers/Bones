# Bones
Bones is a novel video game that packs entirely different forms of gameplay from different genres into their own boss fights. It serves as a "sampler plate" of different types of video games.

Bones is also a project meant to serve as a demonstration of technical ideas and implementations, with a very robust codebase that makes it easy to add onto and expand; along with incorporating neat technical concepts, such as creative shaders, novel projectile targetting ideas, clever camera manipulation, and more.
